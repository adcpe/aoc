# Advent of Code

A repo of my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I'll try to catch up on past years and solve them in different languages.

To start a new year/language, I will create scripts that generate the folder structure, so I don't have to repeat this action every time with each new day.

## Languages

|  Language  |     Command     |
| :--------: | :-------------: |
| JavaScript | `node build.js` |

## Folder structure

```
 .
└──  [YEAR]
   └──  [LANGUAGE]
      └──  [DAY]
         ├──  code1.js (for part 1)
         ├──  code2.js (for part 2)
         ├──  input.txt (input text given)
         ├──  README.md (just a convenient link to the challenge)
         └──  solution.txt (answers to both parts)
```
