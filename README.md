# Advent of Code

A repo of my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I'll try to catch up on past years and solve them in different languages.

## Folder structure

```
 .

         ├──  input.txt (input text given)
         ├──  README.md (just a convenient link to the challenge)

```
